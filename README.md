SCAMPy (Single Column Atmospheric Model in Python) provides a framework for testing parameterizations of clouds and turbulence.
It is particularly designed to support eddy-diffusivity mass-flux modeling frameworks. 

Information about the EDMF parameterization implemented in SCAMPy can be found in:

The code is written in Python and Cython.
